# Image compressor processor for Sprockets

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botandrose/sprockets-image_compressor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/botandrose/sprockets-image_compressor)

Sprockets preprocessor to losslessly compress .png and .jpg images using [pngcrush](http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/) and [jpegoptim](http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/projects.html).

## Integration with Rails 3.1+

Just add this gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sprockets-image_compressor'
````

The gem ships with a Railtie which will automatically register the compressor preprocessors.

To change strategy to lossy, add to your `config/initializers/assets.rb`:

```ruby
Sprockets::ImageCompressor.strategy = :aggressive
```

Valid strategies are `[nil, :conservative, :aggressive]`

## Now with vendored binary fallbacks / Heroku support!

If the environment doesn't have pngcrush and/or jpegoptim installed, the gem will fall back on binaries packaged with the gem. Currently, only 32bit and 64bit linux binaries are included. Pull requests welcome for other architectures!

If fallbacks not work - there is a buildpack for those binaries as well:

- https://github.com/bobbus/image-optim-buildpack
- https://github.com/jayzes/heroku-buildpack-pngquant

## Gotchas

If you have other sprockets processors registered for images, e.g. `sprockets-webp`, the relative order that they are required can matter. Please load `sprockets-image_compressor` _before_ the others:

```ruby
gem 'sprockets-image_compressor'
gem 'sprockets-webp'
```

See [#15](https://github.com/botandrose/sprockets-image_compressor/issues/15) for more information.
